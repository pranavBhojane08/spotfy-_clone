# spotfy-_clone
This is a simple clone of the popular music streaming service, Spotify. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases essential features like browsing songs, creating playlists, and listening to music. The goal of this project is to replicate the user interface and functionality of Spotify while enhancing my web development skills.
